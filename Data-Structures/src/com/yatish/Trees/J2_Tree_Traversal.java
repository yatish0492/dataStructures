		 * The maximum number of nodes at level 'l' of a binary tree is?
		 * 		2^(l-1), considering root level=1.
		 *
		 * Maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height 'h' is?
		 * 		2^h - 1
		 *
		 *
		 * What are the types of tree traversal?
		 * There are 2 types,
		 * 1) Depth First Traversal
		 * 		It will first goto the lowest child and then traverse the tree.
		 * 		There are 3 types in it,
		 * 		a) PreOrder
		 * 		b) InOrder
		 * 		c) PostOrder
		 * 2) Breadth First Traversal
		 * 		It will start traversing from root.
		 *
		 *
		 *
		 * What is BST?
		 * 		BST is binary search tree. each nodes left node will have lesser value and right node have higher value.
		 *
		 *
		 *
		 * NOTE:
		 *  ********* Just know that recursively in trees for traversing it recursively calling the current function with
		 * 			  currentNode.left and then currentNode.right will goto each node of the tree.we can add our required
		 * 			  logics accordingly.
