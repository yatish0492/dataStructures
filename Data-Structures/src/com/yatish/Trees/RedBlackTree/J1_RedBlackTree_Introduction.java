     What is Red Black Tree?
        It is same as AVL tree. It is also balanced tree, it will re-balance based on insertion and deletion. Just that
        in Red Black Tree indirectly say that it balanced tree using colors.
        Basically Red Black tree means each nodes are colored 'Red' and 'Black' color alternatively. We mark root nodes
        as 'Black' and during re-balancing it can be changed to any 'Red' node.
        Traversal to any leaf node from root node will involve same number of 'Black' nodes including color of leaf
        node. This condition makes sure that the tree is balanced.


     NOTE : ******************************** IMPORTANT *************************************************
                                  Red Black Tree = AVL Tree
            The same programs of that of AVL should be used for any(insertion or deletion etc.) programs of
            of Red Black Tree.
